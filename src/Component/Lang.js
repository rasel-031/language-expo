        Programming languages are one kind of computer language and are used in
        computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages
        consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines
        that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming
        languages.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more
        are being created every year. Here, we have shown some very useful
        programming languages.

          <p className="lang-para">
            C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. It was
            developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.
            It is an object-oriented programming language that gives a clear
            structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering
            development costs. It is portable and can be used to develop
            applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

            Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming
            language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community.
            First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for
            Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had
            been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern
            language features. It is an awesome language.
